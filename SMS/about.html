		<dd>Civil Engineering, listed by the Web of Science, is the ICE's flagship journal. Practical and diverse in its scope, it publishes overview papers for the non-specialist on any subject relevant to civil engineering today. Topics range from landmark projects to philosophical, ethical, environmental, management and safety issues.<br>

        Peer review, copyediting, and colour publication by Civil Engineering are free. If accepted, published papers are easily found by Google search, as well as in specialist citation indexes. There is also the option of making your article open access, should you wish to.<br>

        Published authors receive a free electronic copy of their article to share with their peers. Furthermore, as well exposure to ICE's 91,000-strong membership, published papers are promoted via our social media channels, accessing the wider civil engineering community.<br>

        It is free to submit a paper to this journal. Papers appear Ahead of Print (below) as soon as they are ready to be published. Ahead of print articles are fully citable. using the DOI system<br>

        Awards: Every year, the papers rated best by the Editorial Panel are awarded the Coopers Hill War Memorial Prize. In 2019, the journal won the ICE's Stephenson Medal for Second Best Paper overall and in 2020 the Overseas Prize for best paper written by overseas authors or covering an overseas project..<br><br>

<dt>Computer Engineering</dt>
 <img src="assets/img/CE.jpg" alt="icon" style="width:200px height:150; float: left; margin:10px;">
<dd>Computer engineering (CpE) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture.[2]<br>

Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, designing analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit boards, and designing operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.<br>

In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.</dd>
