					<dd>Innovative research. State-of-the-art facilities. Talented and dedicated faculty. Distinguished alumni. All part of the fabric that makes the MWU School of Engineering experience one of the best a student will have anywhere in the nation, while building the foundation for a successful career. School of Engineering is a bridge to the future, pioneering new technologies and developing solutions to the problems facing the world. MU engineering and computer science faculty, students and staff are committed to answering the call for solid interdisciplinary research and engineering education.

The 2 undergraduate degree programs the school offers let our students hone the technical and critical thinking skills they need to succeed.

Mid-Western University’s School of Engineering educates future leaders in the fundamentals of engineering in an environment of world-class research. We stress an interdisciplinary approach and a broad understanding of underlying global issues. Collaborations across the campus and beyond strengthen our development of technological advances that address challenges of vital importance to us all.

MISSION AND STRATEGIC PLAN

The mission at the Mid-Western University School of Engineering is to give the students a high-quality educational experience; to generate and apply knowledge through research, development and scholarly activity; and to serve society, the state No. 6 and the engineering profession.

The primary objective is to produce graduates with the technical competence to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering; to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems; to design and conduct experiments, including the analysis and interpretation of data; to design a system, component or process to meet desired needs; and to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

The goals of the faculty, staff and administration are to:

1. Serve MWU Engineering students through a balanced undergraduate and graduate education program and strive to help each of them achieve their full potential.<br>
2. Serve the state, region and country through research conducted by individual and groups of faculty researchers. Group efforts are particularly encouraged.<br>
3. Serve the state, region and nation through professional activities, short courses and other contributions.

<dt><h3>Salient Features</h3></dt>
<dd>The School of Engineering has embarked on a strategic plan that leads to significant expansion while taking explicit care to maintain and improve the high-quality student programs the university is known for. The Building on Excellence Initiative is a multi-faceted approach that drives growth in facilities, faculty, leadership, research and, most important, students, as it helps industry partners find the new talent, designs and techniques they need to fuel economic growth and business success.

Over the next several years, the MWU School of Engineering will:

Increase by more than 60 percent, the number of students graduating with a bachelor's degree in engineering or computing
Add faculty members to match the growing enrollment and maintain the desirable student/faculty ratio of 23:1
Add support staff to lead expansion of student recruitment, retention and support activities, and
Add facilities that address the high-tech research, classroom and office space necessary for successful expansion. The proposed buildings, constructed in phases, will increase by nearly 60 percent the amount of space available for MWU School of Engineering activities and endeavors.
These endeavors tie in exceptionally well to the university's own strategic plan.

The Building on Excellence Initiative is supported through resources from a variety of partners, including the State research funding and, in part, through additional revenue from growing enrollment.</dd>
